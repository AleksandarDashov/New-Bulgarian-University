Write a C++ program that generates a random cipher for text messages. Each letter in the alphabet is substituted by another letter in a random manner. The program must be able both to encode and decode messages using the generated cipher. The program must have the following features:

    The program generates a cipher by replacing each Latin letter in the alphabet by one of the other letters, based on the pseudo-random numbers generator. 
    Two different letters cannot be replaced by the same letter.
    The program reads a message in English from the standard input and encodes it using the random cipher. 
    The result is printed in the standard output.
    The program reads a ciphered message from the standard input and decodes it using the same cipher.
    Again, the result is printed in the standard output.

Technical requirements: The program must contain at least one class, implemented in a separate header and source file.
