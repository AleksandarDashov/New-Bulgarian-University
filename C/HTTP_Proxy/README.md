Implement a HTTP proxy to http://www.nbu.bg using passiveTCP() and connectTCP() that works as an application gateway used for caching with hashing (using URL as cache index) of the web pages, and of the .gif and .jpg files. 
Use threads to ensure concurrency if more than one clients are using the proxy.
